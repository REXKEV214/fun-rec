- Latest Technologies Development Trends
- Practical Applications in Business Scenarios 
- HR Interview Skills

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

Through this tutorial, you will be able to:
- 🔧 **Master Core Algorithms**：Deeply understand the core principles of algorithms in each phase of recommendation systems

- 💻 **Gain Practical Experience**：Obtain end-to-end recommendation system development experience through project practice
- 📈 **Keep Up with the Latest Technologies**：Understand the latest trends and technologies in recommendation systems
- 🎯 **Pass the Technical Interview**：Have the competitiveness for recommendation algorithm engineer positions

We also establish a **FunRec learning community (WeChat group + knowledge planet)**, where the WeChat group is convenient for daily communication and discussion, and the knowledge planet is convenient for content retention. Some early recorded videos related to technology are also on Bilibili [All technical sharing content is on Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/431850986/channel/collectiondetail?sid=339597). Since the WeChat group's QR code is only valid for 7 days, just add the following WeChat Code, with remark: **Fun-Rec**, you will be added into a Fun-Rec discussion group. If you think the WeChat group is too noisy, it is recommended to add the knowledge planet directly!
